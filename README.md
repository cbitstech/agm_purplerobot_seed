====================

This application is intended to be used at the SLAM / Ortus / AGM Hackathon

To make use of this application:

1. [Download Purple Robot onto your Android device from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.northwestern.cbits.purple_robot_manager)
2. Clone this repo to your local machine
3. Make any modifications to this application that you'd like to make in order to serve your own nefarious but socially beneficial purposes
4. Make a ZIP of the contents of this application's root folder
5. Build this application using [build.phonegap.com](build.phonegap.com) a web based UI that requires a free account (using your github handle), if you're feeling fancy, feel free to use the standalone [Command Line Interface](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html)
6. Update the Purple Robot Application to point to the endpoint for the hackathon


Quick notes
===========

This application is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of Purple Robot as a middle-ware for client-side mobile applications.
You'll need a basic understanding of HTML / JS to build a PhoneGap application.

The benefit of this kind of build process is that you can bring your own Javascript framework--in production grade applications you may want to use something like AngularJS, Backbone, or Ember. A fantastic comparison of these frameworks can be found at [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).
